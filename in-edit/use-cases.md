### Configuration files

Configuration files are notorious for growing in complexity as features are
added and third-party modules are developed. Namespace collisions can become a

Consider, for example, this invented scenario. Suppose a web framework provides
the developer with tools for how a page should be displayed. A configuration
might look like this:

```json
{
	
}
```
